long time alone he lived in the hills
a hunter of beast and hater of men,
or orcs, or elves, till outcast folk
there one by one, wild and reckless
around him rallied; and roaming far
they were feared by both foe and friend of old.
for hot with hate was the heart of turin,
nor a friend found him such folk of thingol
as he wandering met in the wood's fastness.
there beleg the brave on the borders of doriath
they found and fought -- and few were with him --
and o'erborne by numbers they bound him at last,
till their captain came to their camp at eve.
afar from that fight his fate that day
had taken turin on the trail of the orcs,
as they hastened home to the hills of iron
with the loot laden of the lands of men.
then soon was him said that a servant of thingol
they had tied to a tree -- and turin coming
stared astonied on the stern visage
of beleg the brave his brother in arms,
of whom he learned the lore of leaping blades,
and of bended bow and barbed shaft,
and the wild woodland's wisdom secret,
when they blent in battle the blood of their wounds.
then turin's heart was turned from hate,
and he bade unbind beleg the huntsman.
'now fare thou free! but, of friendship aught
if thy heart yet holds for hurin's son,
never tell thou tale that turin thou sawst
an outlaw unloved from elves and men,
whom thingol's thanes yet thirst to slay.
betray not my trust or thy troth of yore!'
then beleg of the bow embraced him there --
he had not fared to the fast or the fall of orgof --
there kissed him kindly comfort speaking:
'lo! nought know i of the news thou tellest;
but outlawed or honoured thou ever shalt be
the brother of beleg, come bliss come woe!
yet little me likest that thy leaping sword
the life should drink of the leaguered elves.
are the grim glamhoth then grown so few,
or the foes of faerie feeble-hearted,
that warlike men have no work to do?
shall the foes of faerie be friends of men?
betrayest thou thy troth whom we trusted of yore?'
'nor of armed orc, nor [of] elf of the wood,
nor of any on earth have i honour or love,
o beleg the bowman. this band alone
i count as comrades, my kindred in woe
and friendless fate -- our foes the world.'
'let the bow of beleg to your band be joined;
and swearing death to the sons of darkness
let us suage our sorrow and the smart of fate!
our valour is not vanquished, nor vain the glory
that once we did win in the woods of old.'
thus hope in the heart of hurin's offspring
awoke at those words; and them well liked
of that band the boldest, save blodrin only --
blodrin bor's son, who for blood and for gold
alone lusted, and little he recked
whom he robbed of riches or reft of life,
were it elf or orc; but he opened not
the thoughts of his heart. there throbbed the harp,
where the fires flickered, and the flaming brands
of pine were piled in the place of their camp;
where glad men gathered in good friendship
as dusk fell down on the drear woodland.
then a song on a sudden soaring loudly --
and the trees up-looming towering harkened --
was raised of the wrack of the realm of the gods;
of the need of the gnomes on the narrow crossing;
of the fight at fangros, and feanor's sons'
oath unbreakable. then up sprang beleg:
'that our vaunt and our vows be not vain for ever,
evern such as they swore, those seven chieftains,
an oath let us swear that is unchanging
as tain-gwethil's towering mountain!'
their blades were bared, as blood shining
in the flame of the fires while they flashed and touched.
as with one man's voice the words were spoken,
and the oath uttered that must unrecalled
abide for ever, a bond of truth
and friendship in arms, and faith in peril.
thus war was waked in the woods once more
for the foes of faerie, and its fame widely,
and the fear of that fellowship, now fared abroad;
when the horn was heard of the hunting elves
that shook the shaws and the sheer valleys.
blades were naked and bows twanging,
and the shafts from the shadows shooting winged,
even in angband the orcs trembled.
then the word wandered down the ways of the forest
that turin thalion was returned to war;
and thingol heard it, and his thanes were sped
to lead the lost one in love to his halls --
but his fate was fashioned that they found him not.
little gold they got in that grim warfare,
but weary watches and wounds for guerdon;
nor on robber-raids now rode they ever,
who fended from faerie the fiends of hell.
but blodrin bor's son for booty lusted,
for the loud laughter the the lawless days,
and meats unmeasured, and mead-goblets
refilled and filled, and the flagons of wine
that went as water in their wild revels.
now tales have told that trapped as a child
he was dragged by the dwarves to their deep mansions,
and in nogrod nurtured, and in nought was like,
spite blood and birth, to the blissful elves.
his heart hated hurin's offspring
and the bowman beleg; so biding his while
he fled their fellowship and forest hidings
to the merciless orcs, whose moon-pallid
cruel-curved blades to kill spare not;
than whose greed for gold none greater burns
save in hungry hearts of the hell-dragons.
he betrayed his troth; traitor made him
and the forest fastness of his fellows in arms
he opened to the orcs, nor his oath heeded.
there they fought and fell by foes outnumbered,
by treachery trapped at a time of night
when their fires faded and few were waking --
some wakened never, not for wild noises,
nor cries nor curses, nor clashing steel,
swept as they slumbered to the slades of death.
but turin they took, though towering mighty
at the huntsman's hand he hewed his foemen,
as a bear at bay mid bellowing hounds,
unheeding his hurts; at the hest of morgoth
yet living they lapped him, his limbs entwining,
with hairy hands and hideous arms.
then beleg was buried in the bodies of the fallen,
as sorely wounded he swooned away;
and all was over, and the orcs triumphed.
the dawn over doriath dimly kindled
saw blodrin bor's son by a beech standing
with throat thirled by a thrusting arrow,
whose shaven shaft, shod with poison,
and feather-winged, was fast in the tree.
he bargained the blood of his brothers for gold:
thus his meed was meted -- in the mirk at random
by an orc-arrow his oath came home.
from the magic mazes of melian the queen
they haled unhappy hurin's offspring,
lest he flee his fate; but they fared slowly
and the leagues were long of their laboured way
over hill and hollow to the high places,
where the peaks and pinnacles of pitiless stone
looming up lofty are lapped in cloud,
and veiled in vapours vast and sable;
where eiglir engrin, the iron hills, lie
o'er the hopeless halls of hell upreared
wrought at the roots of the roaring cliffs
of thangorodrim's thunderous mountain.
thither led they laden with loot and evil;
but beleg yet breathed in blood drenched
aswoon, till the sun to the south hastened,
and the eye of day was opened wide.
then he woke and wondered, and weeping took him,
and to turin thalion his thoughts were turned,
that o'erborne in battle and bound he had seen.
then he crawled from the corpses that had covered him over,
so thingol's thanes athirst and bleeding
in the forest found him: his fate willed not
that he should drink the draught of death from foes.
thus they bore him back in bitter torment
his tidings to tell in the torchlit halls
of thingol the king; in the thousand caves
to be
